One can see that the outputs of containers differ. 
This behaviour is caused by different containers having 
different volumes when using `StatefulSet` with `volumeClaimTemplates`. 
Each replica has its own volume and if the replica is terminated, its`
volume will be assigned to new replica.
Using deployment would cause all the containers having the same volume and, 
thus slowing down due to concurrent access.

Running replicas are completely independent of each other. 
Thus ordering only makes startup longer and does not give any advantages.

I implemented it setting `PodManagementPolicy` to `Parallel`

Check that containers started simultaneously
```bash
[insaf@man k8s]$ kubectl get po
NAME           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
app-python-0   0/1     Running   0          18s
app-python-1   0/1     Running   0          18s
app-python-2   0/1     Running   0          18s
```
